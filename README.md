# Decentralized Lottery (Raffle) System

## 📜 Project Description
The Decentralized Lottery System is a smart contract-based raffle where participants can enter by paying a fixed amount of ETH. At the end of the lottery, a random winner is selected to receive the entire prize pool.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to create a transparent, fair, and tamper-proof lottery system that eliminates the need for a centralized authority or third-party organizers.

## ✨ Key Features
- ETH-based entry system for participants.
- Automated winner selection using pseudo-random logic.
- Transparent balance and participant list viewing.
- Only the contract manager can initiate the winner selection.![Screenshot (8)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e32d860-3ff7-4903-bbf5-179aa7e6c4bd)
